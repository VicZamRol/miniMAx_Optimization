Game based in miniMax optimization: 


The vulture and the crows


You need the game board, in the form of a 5-pointed star, a black piece (the
vulture) and seven white tokens (the crows).
Game rules:
The game always begins when he plays with the crows, placing one of his
chips anywhere on the board. Next, the vulture is placed in the box
what you want From then on, the shifts between the two are alternated
players.
Movements for the one who plays with the crows:
1. If you still have chips left to place, you must place a crow in one of the
Free squares of the board.
2. If you have already placed all, you can choose a crow and move it to a box
adjacent empty (following the lines).
Movements for the one who plays with the vulture:
1. From the second movement the vulture can move, following the
lines, to an adjacent empty square or eat the crows you can.
2. The vulture eats a crow jumping on it (same movement as in the
game of the ladies), being able to eat several in a single movement by
half of several jumps. The vulture is interested in eating as many as possible
of crows so they can not corner him.
End of the game:
The crows win: if they block and corner the vulture.
The vulture wins: if he eats four crows, he wins.
